                Major steps along the way include an open source Unity World Engine and a master thesis project that
                investigated the translation of political power dynamics into a general playful data framework.
                OnlyWorlds is now in closed alpha with two applications available for testing: a mobile app developed in
                Flutter, and a desktop wrapper for Unity. Initial focus is on validating, expanding, and refining its
                data structures.
