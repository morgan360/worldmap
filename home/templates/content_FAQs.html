    <p class="custom-font mb-0">What does OnlyWorlds do?</p>
    <ul class="custom-font accordion-content accordion-list-item">
        <li>Offer a data structure to build applications on top of and worlds into, with some essential tooling, and ways to store and ship
            worlds around.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p class="custom-font mb-0">How do I use this?</p>
    <ul class="custom-font accordion-content accordion-list-item">
        <li>Download the mobile app, create some things, export world, import in Explorer, make more edits, send back to
            mobile, give some feedback, help develop.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>


    <p class="custom-font mb-0">Most of my fields are locked on mobile?!</p>
    <ul class="custom-font accordion-content accordion-list-item">
        <li>Attribute groups and fields can be permanently unlocked through the Progression system, but you can
            longpress a locked group to unlock everything until the app is closed.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <br>
    <p class="custom-font mb-0">What's with all the categories and groups and fields and types and subtypes that I
        totally don't agree with? </p>
    <ul class="custom-font accordion-content accordion-list-item">
        <li>Everything is a suggestion: consider what I present here a starting point that offers some data utility and,
            hopefully, usability. It came from a single mind, and so I eagerly anticipate feedback, as much and as
            detailed as you care to give.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="custom-font mb-0">What are you going to charge for this? </p>
    <ul class="custom-font accordion-content accordion-list-item">
        <li>I will always keep the framework and core tools for it completely free. Other
            developers are welcome to offer software with any pricing models, and I hope to offer optional services and
            perhaps a paid app once the framework is fully in place.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="custom-font mb-0">Any kind of world, transferable, game-compatible.. is all this actually possible? </p>
    <ul class="custom-font accordion-content accordion-list-item">
        <li>Yes. I built a proof of concept with Worldsmith's simulation, and have increased the scope since then.
            Maintaining 'maximum' flexibility & intuitiveness while identifying essential data 'hooks' for code is an ambitious and
            long-term quest, without a clear optimal end state. More of a process of identifying key needs
            and compromises to both these needs, repeated many times over. The current definition of the
            framework is, considering the full scope of this challenge, still in a very early stage, but does already
            support some essential game- and simulation integration.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="custom-font mb-0">Are my world keys tied to my account? </p>
    <ul class="custom-font accordion-content accordion-list-item">
        <li>Would be nice (or, essential), but they're not. Anyone that has a world key can fetch that world and
            override it, so be
            careful who you share it with, and make world copies both locally and under additional world keys.
            There are some obvious issues with this, but consider it a wild-west prototype solution until I can build
            proper authentication towards the open release.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="custom-font mb-0">What long term role do you see for OnlyWorlds? </p>
    <ul class="custom-font accordion-content accordion-list-item">
        <li>As a facilitator. I want to guide this community quest towards an optimum, or (more realistically)
            sufficient, data framework, and provide its open technical infrastructure: so that developers
            can extend it, and creatives can enjoy it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="custom-font mb-0">Can I have more customization? </p>
    <ul class="custom-font accordion-content accordion-list-item">
        <li>It's high on the list. A custom-field system is possible, and in Mapper I already built a system for
            customizing Types and
            Subtypes. This is not on offer currently as I want to fully rework this for the 1.0 release, to include a
            'template' system, so that if you choose to specify e.g. 'low fantasy' you'd get a different set of base types,
            and perhaps even fields, than for a sci-fi world. A challenge here is making it different in form, but still support the function.
        </li>
